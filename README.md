*“A wise man seeks the truth for he knows it will always find him” -- Sergey Nazarov*

## Overview and Origin
* Name of company
  * [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link/)
<br/>

* When was the company incorporated?
  * The company was founded in 2014 and based in Grand Cayman, Midland, Cayman Islands.
<br/>

* Who are the founders of the company?
  * [Sergey Nazarov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeydnazarov/)
<br/>

* What does Chainlink do?
  * Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network. In blockchain, oracles refer to a data feed that connects blockchains to off-blockchain data, such as the outcome of a UFC match or retrieving weather data to help calculate insurance premiums. Chainlink acts as a "blockchain middleware" due to its ability to provide accurate essential information such as price feeds, event results, weather data, and the security of traditional payment systems such as SWIFT.
<br/>

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
  * Chainlink Labs had 4 initial funding rounds in 2017 totalling up to 32 million USD.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  * Blockchains use mathematical cryptography to practically guarantee security, trust, and decentralization. However, there are multiple blockchain networks and getting information to and from the outside world has always created vulnerability. This created a need to trust a source outside the blockchain to provide accurate information.
<br/>

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
  * Chainlink created an open network of nodes, which is a point of connection that can create, receive, store, and send data along a distributed network. Anyone can create a Chainlink node and provide off-chain data to smart contracts. In return, node operators receive LINK tokens as payment for their services. To make sure that node operators provide honest data, staked LINK tokens will be used as collateral to pay penalties in case a node delivers bad data.

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
  - Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies
<br/>

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
  - The financial services industry have been one of the early adopters of blockchain technology. Today, maturing technologies and evolving standards are boosting enterprise adoption of blockchain platforms.
  - The major trends of this domain have mainly been BTC & ETH, the two biggest cryptocurrencies in the market have been applied to many different applications by the use of smart contracts which gave birth to many decentralized applications (DAAPS). 
.
<br/>

* Who is the major competitor of the company?
  - BAND protocol is the second biggest oracle provider. However BAND is located on the Cosmos blockchain while LINK is located on the Ethereum blockchain. 
  
    |  ChainLink Marketcap  |  BAND Protocol Marketcap  |
    |  -------------------  |  -----------------------  |
    |    $3,171,920,939     |         $50,904,339       |

  - Chainlink established itself in the oracle space early on and continues to partner with companies in and out of the Blockchain domain.
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
  * This company is relatively new and has established itself extremely well in the smart contract space.
  * Chainlink is growing exponentially in partnerships, total value secured by oracles, and seems to be lightyears ahead of its competitors.
<br/>

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
  * Chainlink measures success through many things such as the number of partnerships, number of node operators, number of staked LINK tokens, and total value secured by Chainlink oracles.
  * Chainlink had secured roughly 6 billion USD by the end of 2020 and peaked at 75 billion USD in 2021. Currently it is [securing](https://chain.link/) roughly 20 billion USD.
<br/>

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
  * Chainlink has established a long list of partners over that past few years, one of which being Google!
  * Chainlink is different than other oracle projects because it acts as a secure bridge between decentralized applications and traditional businesses. The points where data comes into the blockchain are also the points that can be manipulated or falsified -- this is where Chainlink creates value where others cannot.
  * To minimize the potential failure of an oracle, Chainlink prioritizes 3 main principles; distribution of data sources, distribution of oracles, and use of trusted hardware.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

   - Currently Chainlink node operators can stake their LINK tokens to be used as collateral for maintaining the network. In return, they get a steady interest yield on their staked tokens.  
   - I think it would be cool if retail investors could also stake their tokens, generate a steady interest yield, and be a part of maintaining the Chainlink network. 
<br/> 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
   - I think it would bring a lot of attention towards the company. Many cryptocurrencies offer high yield interest rates and usually brings in many users.
   - The company will also become even more trustworthy than it already is since more cash will be secured (staked) into the network. 
<br/>

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
   - A DAAP or decentralized application that implements Chainlink staking. 
<br/>

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
   - A web3 application will provide a more secure way for Chainlink to gather staked funds and also have the ability to use it on multiple blockchains.
