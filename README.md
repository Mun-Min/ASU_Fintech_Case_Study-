# Fintech Case Study  

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
  * [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link/)
<br/>
* When was the company incorporated?
  * The company was founded in 2014 and based in Grand Cayman, Midland, Cayman Islands.
<br/>
* Who are the founders of the company?
  * Sergey Nazarov
<br/>
* What does Chainlink do?
  * Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network. In blockchain, oracles refer to a data feed that connects blockchains to off-blockchain data, such as the outcome of a UFC match or retrieving weather data to help calculate insurance premiums. Chainlink acts as a "blockchain middleware" due its ability to provide accurate essential information such as price feeds, event results, weather data, and the security of traditional payment systems such as SWIFT.
<br/>
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
  * Chainlink Labs had 4 initial funding rounds in 2017 totalling up to 32 million USD.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  * Blockchains use mathematical cryptography to practically guarantee security, trust, and decentralization. However, there are multiple blockchain networks and getting information to and from the outside world has always created vulnerability. This created a need to trust a source outside the blockchain to provide accurate information.
<br/>
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
  * Chainlink created an open network of nodes, which is a point of connection that can create, receive, store, and send data along a distributed network. Anyone can create a Chainlink node and provide off-chain data to smart contracts. In return, node operators receive LINK tokens as payment for their services. To make sure that node operators provide honest data, staked LINK tokens will be used as collateral to pay penalties in case a node delivers bad data.

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
  * This company is relatively new and has established itself extremely well in the smart contract space.
  * Chainlink is growing exponentially in partnerships, total value secured by oracles, and seems to be lightyears ahead of its competitors.
<br/>
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
  * Chainlink measures success through many things such as the number of partnerships, number of node operators, number of staked LINK tokens, and total value secured by Chainlink oracles.
  * Chainlink had secured roughly 6 billion USD by the end of 2020 and peaked at 75 billion USD in 2021. Currently it is securing roughly 20 billion USD
<br/>
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
  * Chainlink has established a long list of partners over that past few years, one of which being Google!
  * Chainlink is different than other oracle projects because it acts as a secure bridge between decentralized applications and traditional businesses. The points where data comes into the blockchain are also the points that can be manipulated or falsified -- this is where Chainlink creates value where others cannot.
  * To minimize the potential faliure of an oracle, Chainlink prioritizes 3 main principles; (1) distribution of data sources, (2) distribution of oracles, and use of trusted hardware.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
